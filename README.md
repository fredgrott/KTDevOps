The crucial key to WINNING in the flatline smartphone users growth market is to 
double up using your full dev and design process to do fast small incremental 
new feature android app builds as the new interest from users about new 
features is a very contagious disease in all social platforms. 
Android DevOps plays the key role in this.

# Note

This assumes starting from a clean slate. Most other projects one would convert
the project to mvvm clean arch and groupon grox state support first than clean up
code to get a release and than do amjor conversion to kotlin and rxjava.
