# KTDevOps

The crucial key to WINNING in the flatline smartphone users growth market is to 
double up using your full dev and design process to do fast small incremental 
new feature android app builds as the new interest from users about new 
features is a very contagious disease in all social platforms. 
Android DevOps plays the key role in this.
Repo contains a sample setup for Android Kotlin non-robolectric for now.

# Note

Hey startup cofounders read this part! Adding a 2nd android dev with kotlin and rxjava will not rescue the project if the
wrong app arch and wrong lib tools and frameworks was made prior to getting the kotlin religion. Hoenstly, you will need to
understand that the app will have to be rewritten as a MVRx MVVM clean arch kotlin rxjava android app and that it will be a
brutual project marhc of 7 day weeks for about 4 moonths to fix the prior bad android code smell.

Want me to draw you a picture?
